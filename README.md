# Code Refactor Starter Code
I made the code more semantic. Replacing all the div elements to more appropriate tags including
header, nav, section, aside, and footer. This makes reading the code easier, giving
easier direction of where you are on the html page. I also replaced span tag with label tag.
On line 29 in the html, the link to "Search Engine Optimization" at the header didnt function correctly,
I changed the class tag to an "id" tag and added another class tag "search-engine-optimization" so th link would work as intended like the other two links in the footer did.# coreyk-challenge-week1
